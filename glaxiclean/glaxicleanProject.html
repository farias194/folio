<!--<p>glaxiclean is a green cleaning company based in 
    northern NJ. I was tasked with creating a brand new identity, website, and buisiness card. 
    The brand revolves around the swirling motion one maks when cleaning a service, as well as the idea of clearing up .</p>-->
    <p>Cleaning companies are a dime a dozen. Glaxiclean’s different. 
        glaxiclean is a cleaning company that wanted to differentiate itself from it’s competition. I was approached for a website for customers to learn about 
        Glaxiclean, as well as a logo and buisinesscard.</p>
        <p>research found that competitors in the home cleaning buisiness had similar branding and voice. In order to differentiate itself from the competition, the goal was to differentiate Glaxiclean through a bespoke brand identity that still remained recognizable as a home cleaning service provider. This was achieved through the use of graphics that invoke the act of cleaning itself as well as the logo.</p>
